                        In a group of 2-3, create an interactive story with multiple choices and branches for readers to
                        follow. Unlike a regular story, they are linear and the character’s destinies are already
                        chosen. However, in an interactive story, the players are given 2-3 options to choose what they
                        want to do, eventually leading them towards three possible endings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">My partner and I initiated by brainstorming which type of story we wanted to do.
                        We ended up selecting a dark-fantasy type. It was challenging in the beginning because after
                        communicating and collaborating with each other about our plan we had a hard time trying to
                        start off the story. During the making of our story, we mainly used LucidChart to plan out the
                        paths and branches. We also had a Google Doc to check spelling/grammar but we had a really hard
                        time trying to keep track of our story.

                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        Once we finished our story, we had to start programming and developing our webpage using Visual
                        Studio Code. My partner and I ran into a lot of problems here too since we ran into little
                        errors in our code. We persisted through and continued trying to fix it to see where our
                        mistakes were. Once we finished coding the main structure or function of our website, we finally
                        got to start working on the aesthetics. Since our story was a dark fantasy, we went along with
                        that theme and went with a dark color scheme. We continued to play around with the different
                        effects we could do with CSS. I also made the hero image using Adobe Photoshop to edit it and
                        then blurring out with CSS later to make our title stand out more. We played with the aesthetics
                        of the buttons and ended up with a gif as the background. I find this project a really
                        successful one since we were so persistence while constantly trying to reflect off our mistakes
                        and errors.
