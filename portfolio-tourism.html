                    <p class="content">One of my proudest projects I made this year was the Tourism Project. In a group
                        of 3, each of us had to choose a country to research important information for our tourism
                        themed website targeted towards young adults between the ages 18-29 year old. I chose South
                        Korea and my other partners chose China and Canada. The requirements of this project was to be
                        able to use media queries so our website could easily fit the screen size of a desktop, tablet,
                        and phone. This project needed a ‘Home’ page to introduce and link to the other websites and a
                        ‘Destinations’ page to feature the overview of each country we offered. In addition each country
                        had to have an ‘About’ page to feature the location, demographics, exports, major cities and
                        natural locations, cultural overview, and a brief history of each country, a ‘Discover’ page to
                        feature the cultural traditions, associated locales, and other notable tourist destinations and
                        activities, and ‘Visit’ page to detail the travel options to the country, lodging options, and
                        in-country transportation options available.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">Once we finished writing out all the content needed for the different pages, we
                        used Canva to create a mood board for our website. This mood board was going to be the color
                        palette we used or give somewhat of an idea for our webpage. We had to make sure we communicated
                        a lot while collaborating to make sure that's what we wanted. We wanted to make sure everyone
                        put their ideas out so we can somehow use them for our webpage.</p>
                    <p class="content">
                        After finding our color theme, we used Figma to make an outline of what we wanted our website to
                        look like. We made wireframes of the website so that we can use our ideas and apply them to the
                        design. We kept on having to reflect over our design because along the way we didn’t really like
                        it and got more ideas on how we could improve on it. We had so many challenges during this phase
                        because we continued to get so many ideas on how to make it better. The majority of our time was
                        spent trying to make it the best we could.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        Using Visual Studio Code, we started coding and programming the website. This phase of the
                        project was pretty simple since I understood from my first website, Chronoshift, that all I had
                        to do was make sure I don’t use the specific measures to proportionalized everything. My
                        partners and I had to repeatedly reflect over our progress and persisted through our many
                        mistakes and failures. In the end, our website was a really good success since we got the format
                        we planned. Finally, we used Netfily to publish our website onto a domain so anyone can search
                        and look at our website.
