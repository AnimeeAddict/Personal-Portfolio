                    <p class="content">One of the smaller projects I made is the Calculator Project including two parts.
                        In the first part of the project, I had to create a calculator program that will perform the
                        basic arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Using the
                        prompt method as an input and the alert method as the output. The requirements were that my
                        calculator should use at least one if-else statement and at least one switch. In addition, I had
                        to check to make sure that any input from the user isn’t blank and will be provided in the
                        expected data type and/or format. This calculator was assigned to me mainly because my class was
                        learning how to use JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        First off, I created a file and used Github so I can easily work on the same repository at home
                        and at school. Then I used Visual Studio Code to start coding and programming my calculator. I
                        started making prompts and functions for the foundation of my calculator. It was only a bit
                        challenging since I understood what I was supposed to do and how to manipulate my code.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        Once I finished the first part of the Calculator assignment, I moved onto the second part of the
                        project. The requirements on this part were much harder and more challenging than the first
                        part. I was assigned to design an HTML page that will collect the information for your
                        JavaScript calculator and display the results back on the same page. I started formatting the
                        calculator with divs for buttons and for the calculator itself. After finishing that portion, I
                        moved onto the aesthetics of the page. I wanted it to be somewhat interesting to look at and not
                        just a calculator on a blank page. Unlike HTML and CSS, it took me a lot longer to try and be
                        able to understand but fortunately I persisted and communicated with my classmates and teacher
                        when I got really lost.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        Once I finished with the aesthetics, I started linking the HTML to the JavaScript and this
                        portion was really challenging since I was still trying to figure out how to use functions to
                        collect whatever the input, operate with the imputed integers, and output the answer. I got
                        really lost and didn’t get to figure out how to do it until after the assignment was due. Even
                        though it was late, I was really glad I got to figure it out. This project overall was really
                        challenging for me because during this project I really didn’t understand anything I was doing.
                        Even so, I continued to reflect and persist through this entire project while collaborating with
                        my classmates and teacher.
