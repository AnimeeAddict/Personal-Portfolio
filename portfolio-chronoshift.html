                    <p class="content">The first website I created and programmed was the Chronoshift Expeditions Website. This website
                        is
                        based
                        on a time-traveling safari company from a short story I read in my class, called “A Sound of
                        Thunder” by
                        Ray Bradbury. I was assigned to make a 5 page website to feature the important details of their
                        company
                        and their services. The Home Page is used to welcome and help lead viewers to the other pages
                        this
                        website features. The About Page which features the information about the company, how their
                        technology
                        operates, the company history, contact info, and bios of the fictitious expedition guides. The
                        Expedition Page features the experiences available to potential clients including the events and
                        prices
                        available. The Rules Page which shows the risks, rules, safety, and any other relevant
                        information.
                        Lastly, the Book Now Page allows visitors to complete a form to register for an expedition and
                        digitally
                        'sign' a waiver.

                        There was many softwares I used to help build and publish my Chronoshift Website. Adobe
                        Photoshop to
                        edit the images on all of my pages and Figma was used to frame and prototype what I wanted my
                        website to
                        look like. I learned how to wireframe the structure of my website and prototype my website so I
                        know
                        how
                        it would function. Visual Studio Code was also used to program, create the structure and
                        functionality
                        of the website. Lastly, I used Netlify to publish my website so others can see my finished
                        product.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        I faced a lot of challenges and problems throughout the making of my website. A good example was
                        when I
                        was trying to space out all of my information on my website without using padding. I know
                        putting
                        padding everywhere was really bad so I tried to avoid it if I could. I solved this problem by
                        using
                        &#60;div&#62; so I can easily section it off and then space it out from there. Another problem I
                        encountered was how to make the navigation bar stay horizontal instead of being a list going
                        vertically
                        down. At first, I made it a list but I didn't understand how to make it horizontal but later I
                        ended
                        up
                        changing to &#60;div&#62; since it would automatically be horizontal and I can continue
                        formatting
                        it
                        that way. Lastly, I was trying to portionalize the pictures to the size of the screen but didn't
                        understand how to do so without putting a specific measurement that would fit my current monitor
                        screen.
                        I ended resolving this problem later by using percentages depending on the screen size. Even
                        though
                        I
                        struggled with a lot of things, I am still really proud and happy about a lot of things on my
                        Chronoshift Website. First off, I am really pleased with the athletics of my webpage. The colors
                        correspond with each other so nothing would look out of place. They were easy to look at and
                        went
                        along
                        with the images I picked and photoshopped.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        I employed a lot of CART habits of mind throughout this project. The main traits were
                        collaboration,
                        persistence, and reflection. While creating, designing, and programming my website, I
                        collaborated
                        with
                        my classmates and teacher when I didn't understand something. I would ask how they would do
                        something
                        and explain how they coded it. I persisted throughout my project because I made many mistakes
                        and
                        got
                        stuck a lot but kept going through it. Making errors and mistakes are a very common and normal
                        thing.
                        Being able to learn from them is so important because it prevents those mistakes from repeating.
                        While
                        doing that, I also reflected on where I made my mistakes and how I can fix them. I continuously
                        looked
                        to see where my errors were and how I could fix them. When coding there were so many times where
                        I
                        wouldn't do something correctly but I would work backwards to see where I messed up and fix it.
