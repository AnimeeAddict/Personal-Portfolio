                        Website. This website is based on a time-traveling safari company from a short story I read in
                        my class, called “A Sound of Thunder” by Ray Bradbury. I was assigned to make a 5 page website
                        to feature the important details of their company and their services. The Home Page is used to
                        welcome and help lead viewers to the other pages this website features. The About Page which
                        features the information about the company, how their technology operates, the company history,
                        contact info, and bios of the fictitious expedition guides. The Expedition Page features the
                        experiences available to potential clients including the events and prices available. The Rules
                        Page which shows the risks, rules, safety, and any other relevant information. Lastly, the Book
                        Now Page allows visitors to complete a form to register for an expedition and digitally 'sign' a
                        waiver.

                        There was many softwares I used to help build and publish my Chronoshift Website. Adobe
                        Photoshop to edit the images on all of my pages and Figma was used to frame and prototype what I
                        wanted my website to look like. I learned how to wireframe the structure of my website and
                        prototype my website so I know how it would function. Visual Studio Code was also used to
                        program, create the structure and functionality of the website. Lastly, I used Netlify to
                        publish my website so others can see my finished product.

                    <p class="content">
                        I faced a lot of challenges and problems throughout the making of my website. A good example was
                        when I was trying to space out all of my information on my website without using padding. I know
                        putting padding everywhere was really bad so I tried to avoid it if I could. I solved this
                        problem by using &#60;div&#62; so I can easily section it off and then space it out from there.
                        Another problem I encountered was how to make the navigation bar stay horizontal instead of
                        being a list going vertically down. At first, I made it a list but I didn't understand how to
                        make it horizontal but later I ended up changing to &#60;div&#62; since it would automatically
                        be horizontal and I can continue formatting it that way. Lastly, I was trying to portionalize
                        the pictures to the size of the screen but didn't understand how to do so without putting a
                        specific measurement that would fit my current monitor screen. I ended resolving this problem
                        later by using percentages depending on the screen size. Even though I struggled with a lot of
                        things, I am still really proud and happy about a lot of things on my Chronoshift Website. First
                        off, I am really pleased with the athletics of my webpage. The colors correspond with each other
                        so nothing would look out of place. They were easy to look at and went along with the images I
                        picked and photoshopped.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        I employed a lot of CART habits of mind throughout this project. The main traits were
                        collaboration, persistence, and reflection. While creating, designing, and programming my
                        website, I collaborated with my classmates and teacher when I didn't understand something. I
                        would ask how they would do something and explain how they coded it. I persisted throughout my
                        project because I made many mistakes and got stuck a lot but kept going through it. Making
                        errors and mistakes are a very common and normal thing. Being able to learn from them is so
                        important because it prevents those mistakes from repeating. While doing that, I also reflected
                        on where I made my mistakes and how I can fix them. I continuously looked to see where my errors
                        were and how I could fix them. When coding there were so many times where I wouldn't do
                        something correctly but I would work backwards to see where I messed up and fix it.
