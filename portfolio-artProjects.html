                    <p class="content">Ever since I was little, I’ve always liked doing art like painting and drawing.
                        One of my most recent projects I’ve finished is a white charcoal drawing of a man on a black
                        piece of paper. I did this project for my Art 1 class and I consider it to be one of my most
                        favorite drawings. We were given 4 options to choose from and after choosing they would print it
                        out and we would have to grid it and use it as reference photos. The grid is a technique artists
                        use to transfer the image over onto another piece of paper. Using the grid I drew, I transferred
                        it over onto another larger piece of paper and then slowly sketched out the picture and shaded
                        wherever it was needed. This took a long time but it makes it a lot easier for me to do this
                        project since I’m not just sketching the image onto a large piece of paper and trying to guess
                        which parts go where. This project of the old man in white charcoal on the black piece of paper
                        is one of the best art projects I’ve ever made. It took me about 25 hours to do in total
                        including the process of having to grid it and transfer it over to the other paper. This project
                        made me really persistent because I had to make sure I shaded dark or light enough without
                        completely ruining the texture of the paper. When it comes to anything I do, I like to be really
                        slow but make sure it is just the way I want it to be. This project really showed how much of a
                        perfectionist and patient person I am.</p>

                    <p class="content">Another piece I’ve finished recently is black and white charcoal drawing done on
                        a gray piece of paper, consisting of 3 different sized pots and bowls using the same gridding
                        technique to sketch and draw it out. This drawing was one of the simpler drawings I did but I
                        really like the concept of drawing and shading both the shadows and the highlights of the pots.
                        I’ve never really done a drawing before where you do both the shadows and highlights of the
                        drawing. Traditionally when you draw, you draw the shadows and the picture itself. Since the
                        piece of paper is white it already has the highlights of the pictures. So you just shade in the
                        dark parts of the picture. In addition, this was the second time I’ve ever done a charcoal
                        drawing. Charcoal is really fun and interesting since it is so similar to graphite. Drawing with
                        charcoal is somewhat difficult since it makes it hard for me to keep the shade I want. In class,
                        we only get two hours before we have to put them away which will make the drawing smear a bit
                        when putting them away and taking them out. The only challenging part of this project was trying
                        to initiate the project since it was really difficult trying to figure out where to start since
                        I do have a tendency to put my arm onto the piece of paper while drawing which will smear the
                        drawing I just did.This project didn’t take me long since I understood how to do it and I
                        already know what techniques to use when drawing it. This took me about 5 hours to complete
                        since it was just really simple.</p>

                    <p class="content">Throughout my academic year, I only went to 2-3 art classes. One of the harder
                        classes I took was Advanced Art in 8th grade when I had to do many different types of art
                        projects. One of the projects I did was an acrylic painting I did of a waterfall from a Bob Ross
                        tutorial. This painting made me realize how much I really liked drawing landscapes. Painting
                        them and looking at the result afterwards made me feel really good and relaxed since I can feel
                        how calming the setting can be. This project also made me realize how much fun it can be when
                        painting with acrylic paints. This project made me really persistent since I had to improvise a
                        lot when painting it. There were some times when Bob Ross painted something and techniques were
                        really hard to do so I ended up creating my own techniques when doing this painting. I would
                        like to say this was a really successful painting since it was one of the first times I’ve ever
                        experimented with acrylic painting. Even though there were a lot of challenges, I got to learn a
                        lot and use them to be able to use them for future paintings.</p>

                    <p class="content">After gaining so much experience from my 8th grade Advanced Art class with
                        acrylic painting, I decided to continue trying to refine and improve my painting skills. During
                        my 8th grade summer, I decided to redo this painting of an ocean with the sunset sky behind it
                        from a Bob Ross tutorial I watched. Even though I learned a lot from the first time, I was still
                        struggling with some parts. For example, the hardest challenge I faced was the waves of the
                        water because I couldn’t understand how to do it. It was a lot easier since I understood the
                        process of how to do this painting. This project made me reflect a lot about what I used to do
                        and how I could improve the second time I did it. It was a lot of fun seeing the difference once
                        I finished since it was clear which one was the better one and what techniques I used to improve
                        it the second time.</p>

                    <p class="content">Lastly, the art project I had the most fun with was this clay sculpture I did. We
                        learned how to make pots using the slab techniques. This slab technique was where you took 5 or
                        6 flat slabs of clay and attached them to each other. You would score the sides that were being
                        attached and use water as a binder to keep them together. This was a really fun art project
                        since it allowed me to be more creative with 3d models and not 2d drawings. I decided to have my
                        slab pot inspired by the character BMO from the show Adventure Time. I grew up watching this
                        series so I thought it would be perfect if I made my favorite character from the series. I had a
                        hard time trying to keep it in one piece since after you finish making it and painting it. It
                        had to be fired in the kelm and would be really delicate. Once it was finished, I kept on
                        testing to see how durable it was by moving it back and forth with its legs. After doing that,
                        the leg ended up breaking and now it is having a hard time staying together. It was really fun
                        to be able to play with a different art style and hope I get more opportunities to do more like
                        this.</p>
